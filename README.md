# TAREFA: Layout e navegação

Bootcamp React 3.0 do DEVSUPERIOR, turma 05/2022

Project to fulfill the challenge with the task of implementing the Layout defined in Figma at the link:
https://www.figma.com/file/H1SC2bo3Zaycm3mJxkkMC4/bds-desafio-layout?node-id=0%3A1

## Applied technologies

Creation of a single page application using the toolchain integrated in npx.

Creating routes with React Router DOM

Creation of the front end interface with the Bootstrap framework

Node.JS version used 14.19.2

## Learnings

Better organize the CSS code, creating specific CSS classes for each component at the same level of the hierarchy, thus preventing a style adopted in one component from not influencing another.

Main technologies used: React, Javascript, Typescript, Bootstrap and CSS.

## Best practices in software development

### Code acquisition or update phase

Proper naming of the repository or branches.

Elimination of unnecessary files in version control in Git.

Avoid high battery consumption and use the processor in excess, avoiding duplication of stored information.

Nuisance calls and unnecessary database insertions and updates.

Prevent access to remote information through data network and WiFi, excessive use of GPS and other device sensors.

Extension tools used: Color Highlight, ESLint, HTML Snippets, HTMLHint,
IntelliCode, IntelliSense for CSS, JSX HTML <tags/>, Prettier

### Encoding phase

Code formatting.

Structure to make the code clean, concise and easy to understand.

### Developed code validation phase

Evaluation of code created before integration into the main repository.

### New code integration phase

Code review and use of version control systems

### Test phase

Run tests during the functionality implementation phase, verifying the expected results, also verifying the navigational flows.

Automate, test-driven development, and perform testing activities during development.

### Using good development practices

Awareness of collective activity view evolving source code.
With the managerial and organizational change of mindset, there is an increase in productivity and a more reliable product.

Seek to improve the current scenario regardless of the situation. Identify points for improvement, acquire knowledge, correct defects. Have access to specialized training and materials, participate in events.

Retrospective Meeting (List improvements and propose solutions).
Meeting to present partial deliveries to the client, increased responsibility in meeting deadlines.

### Good programming practices

Programmer actions, direct evolution of the application and related to the source code and improvement of its readability, applicability or architecture.

Maintenance of readable, well-structured, clean, concise, easy-to-understand source code that does not present compilation problems.

Definition of standards, practices and feeling of collaboration and collectivity, avoiding complex situations.

Single language adoption, code indentation and set the number of characters of encoding lines.

Consistent names for classes, variables and constants. Use of few comments with code improvement.

Add related content only when necessary to avoid complicating integration with the main repository.

Avoid code duplication, make the most of object orientation and respect their relationships.

Avoid unnecessary processing.

### Using an architectural pattern

Use the correct architectural pattern for the target application and platform. Split software into MVC/MVP layers for example, layers can group related code and also relate to other layers. Enables code reuse, facilitates unit testing automation.

### Use of design patterns

Use design patterns for known issues, improve code design, simplify basic structure.

Increasing productivity by providing proven models. Contributing to modularization and reuse, this modularization provides greater decoupling.

The correct use of Object Orientation, one of the premises of design standards. It allows a better division of responsibilities between classes, methods and structures in general of the system, improving code readability.

More is expensive, difficult to find the best pattern for various solutions found. One must know the purpose of use of each pattern and identify them correctly and time consuming and requires repetition and study.

Check the impact of the pattern on the application. Remember modularization patterns generate layers that might not exist if not used. Check the standards already established on the target platform.

Exemplos de padrões: Builder, BroadcastReceiver (uso do Observer), Adapter, Memento,
Chain of Responsability, View Holder, Proxy, Composite, Facade, etc.

### Other Good Development Practices

Using Git for version control and tools integrated into the IDEs, for code analysis for example. With version control we have the history of evolution, releases and extensive knowledge of the code by the team facilitating improvements and bug fixes. Establish in advance which files will be versioned and archived in the repository.

You must create source code branches with versions already tested and distributed.

Test cases created by the developer.

Review process in the integration phase.

Automation of compilation, test execution and release generation processes. You can use Jenkins for example.

### Software testing best practices

Participation of professionals from the testing area in all phases of the project.
Identifying risks, exceptions, use cases and overlooked scenarios.
Participate in product evaluation.
Knowledge of flows, features.
Performing tests quickly, the developer is not out of context, speeding up bug fixes.
Automation of repetitive tasks in performing tests.
Using the TDD (Test Driven Development) process, the programmer first develops a test case, then creates the minimum code to fulfill the test, automatically automating the test, increasing the quality standard.
Code produced with this process tends to have fewer dependencies, more concise, and easier to interpret.
